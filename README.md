Hey! So this is my first real contribution README file. From now on, I will make sure to include a README update every time I update anything in all my projects.

10/28/24

Massive update that was long overdue. I have been working on this project for a while now, and I have finally gotten around to make a README file. Updates include:

+ polished the profile card
+ Added LanAPI ( same thing as Lanyard )  to the profile card, this will show the user's status and other information

~ re-furbished the code and the structures to make it more stable

+ very late add, but added a sequence so it auto-updates the status, activity, etc.

-------------------------------------- Notes for Upcoming updates ---------------------------------

- making so the backgound could be changed whenever
- polish LanAPI card on how it looks, it looks too janky for my standarts, but good enough for publish ðŸ˜Ž
- have a changeable backround  and/or including the profile so it doesn't have to be 
- maybe separating the script into different other scripts, so it's easier to read and understandz
