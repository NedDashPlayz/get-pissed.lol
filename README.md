A little side-project made for creating pixelvault's early access bio page, this is unfinished, probably will try to polish it, making an activity tracker via Lanyard, or any other, or this will get intergrated into the page.

Basically I have no idea on that I can so with it, if I have time on Christmas then I will try to polish it and I am not planning to scrape my idea, for now at least.


The page was created as a side-project a couple of months ago, just out of boredom, I bought the site name, which was relatively cheap and I decided, why not?

"Final commit" will not be final, just cleaned the code to make it as neat as I could for the time being.
