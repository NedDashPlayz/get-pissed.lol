A little side-project made for creating pixelvault's early access bio page, this is unfinished, probably will try to polish it, making an activity tracker via Lanyard, or any other, or this will get intergrated into the page.

Basically I have no idea on that I can so with it, if I have time on Christmas then I will try to polish it and I am not planning to scrape my idea, for now at least.


The page was created as a side-project a couple of months ago, just out of boredom, I bought the site name, which was relatively cheap and I decided, why not?

"Final commit" will not be final, just cleaned the code to make it as neat as I could for the time being.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From now on, I will make sure to include a README update every time I update anything in all my projects.

Massive update that was long overdue. I have been working on this project for a while now, and I have finally gotten around to make a README file. Updates include:

+ polished the profile card
+ Added LanAPI ( same thing as Lanyard )  to the profile card, this will show the user's status and other information

~ re-furbished the code and the structures to make it more stable

+ very late add, but added a sequence so it auto-updates the status, activity, etc.

-------------------------------------- Minor fixes from the same date ---------------------------------

~ fixed that it didn't fetch the spotify activity
~ fixed the favicon not showing


-------------------------------------- Notes for Upcoming updates ---------------------------------

- making so the backgound could be changed whenever
- polish LanAPI card on how it looks, it looks too janky for my standarts, but good enough for publish ðŸ˜Ž
- have a changeable backround  and/or including the profile so it doesn't have to be 
- maybe separating the script into different other scripts, so it's easier to read and understandz
- also to-do is to finalize the game icon while playing
